### Objective
The objective of this project is to create a Student Grade Tracker using Java.It should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or GPA).

### Key Activities
-**Grade Calculation Function**: Determines the grade based on the marks provided and prints the corresponding grade and returns a numeric value    
-**Main Method**: Prompts the user to enter student details and marks for six subjects  
-**Calculation of Average Marks**: Computes the average marks of the student across the six subjects  
-**Display of Results**: Outputs the student's name, marks for each subject, corresponding grades, average marks, and GPA  

### Key Insights
-**Grading Logic**: The grading logic is straightforward and uses fixed grade ranges  
-**Average Calculation**: Computes the average marks correctly by summing up the marks and dividing by the number of subjects  
-**GPA Calculation**: Calculates GPA based on the credit hours assigned to each subject
